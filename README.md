# NASA Artemis: Closed-Loop Lunar Waste & Infrastructure Systems
**Technical Specifications for Sustainable Extra-Terrestrial Habitation**

## 1. Executive Summary
This repository contains a suite of seven technical proposals and engineering specifications designed for the NASA Artemis Program. The core focus is the transition from Earth-dependent logistics to **In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU)** and closed-loop waste management. By converting lunar waste into structural building materials, this system addresses the $40,000/kg Earth-to-Moon transport hurdle while providing the foundation for permanent basecamp infrastructure.

## 2. Technical Architecture
The system utilizes a multi-stage mechanical and thermodynamic process to achieve 98% waste-to-material conversion efficiency:

* **Vibrational Sorting & Compaction:** Utilizing resonant frequency-tuned plates and high-torque screw presses to prepare feedstock.
* **Solar Thermal Processing:** A solar concentrator array providing 1,500°C+ for plastic vitrification and regolith-enhanced material bonding.
* **Flywheel Energy Storage (FESS):** Designed for high-density kinetic energy storage to maintain thermal consistency during lunar shadow transitions.
* **Modular Tile Fabrication:** An autonomous production line creating interlocking structural tiles with specific compressive strengths for habitat shielding.

## 3. Engineering Rigor
This work includes full mathematical derivations and analysis for:
* **Rotational Dynamics:** Moment of inertia and angular velocity requirements for energy recovery.
* **Thermodynamics:** Heat flux and vitrification energy demands in extreme vacuum environments.
* **Materials Science:** Tensile and compressive strength testing for regolith-polymer composites.
* **Autonomous Diagnostics:** AI-governed monitoring systems for self-repairing modular units.

## 4. Mission Alignment
These proposals specifically target **NASA Artemis Camp** requirements for:
1.  **Sustainable Human Presence:** Reducing environmental impact and biological contamination on the lunar surface.
2.  **Infrastructure Scalability:** Enabling the 3D-printing of landing pads and radiation shielding using recycled materials.
3.  **Autonomous Logistics:** Minimizing astronaut labor requirements through self-executing mechanical cycles.
